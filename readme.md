# Galoshi Games – Course Project

This project is developed by **Galoshi Games**.  
The goal of the project is to create a series of **laboratory works on strategy games**, which will later be combined into a course project.  

Our project is inspired by classic games **Age of War** and **Battle Cats**, so the labs implement the fundamentals of strategic gameplay logic.

### Lab #1 – Class Structure: Creation and Destruction of Objects
- Developed a **UML Use Case Diagram** describing user actions:
  - starting a new game,
  - buying new stuff.  
- Each team member designed **one or two classes** corresponding to the user actions.
- Implemented a **test scenario to verify the methods** of created classes.

### Lab #2 – Aggregation and Composition
- Extended Lab #1 code by combining classes into a **hierarchy of aggregation or composition relationships**.
- Used standard **C# collections** to store multiple objects.
- Updated the **UML class diagram** according to the new hierarchy.

---

### Lab #3 – Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Created an **inheritance hierarchy for main active objects**:
  - different types of units, events, etc.
- Implemented **polymorphic behavior** for different types of objects:
  - different character behaviors,
  - different event actions.
- Updated the **UML class diagram**.

---

### Lab #4 – Design Patterns
- Completed the implementation of the program's business logic, covering all planned actions.
- Each team member implemented **at least one design pattern**.
- The code functionality is demonstrated similarly to the previous labs.
